# Level Up Your AI knowledge

Hey fam, here in this lesson, we're gonna talk about OpenAI and its GPT models. This is some next-level tech, fam, and it's gonna blow your mind!

## What's the deal with OpenAI?

- OpenAI is a tech lab that's all about creating super smart and safe AI.
- It was founded by some of the biggest tech legends, like Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Greg Brockman.
- Basically, OpenAI is on a mission to make AI more accessible for everyone, so they're always developing new tools and platforms.

Before talking about the OpenAI API, let’s first learn what API is.

## Let’s first learn what is API

Let me break it down for ya.

- An API (Application Programming Interface) is like the go-to guy that lets different software apps chat with each other.
- It's like a translator that makes sure they're all on the same page and sharing info like besties.
- One app sends a request to the API, who then forwards it to the other app. The other app does its thing and sends a response back to the API, who then sends it back to the original app.

So yeah, an API is basically the middleman that helps software apps play nice with each other. Pretty cool, huh?

## Now, let's talk about OpenAI API

- OpenAI API is a powerful tool that lets developers tap into OpenAI's latest and greatest AI models.
- It's perfect for adding cool AI features to your apps and services without having to start from scratch.
- With OpenAI API, developers can easily add natural language processing (NLP) and other AI capabilities to their apps.

## How does OpenAI API actually work?

- OpenAI API is a cloud-based service, which means you can access it from pretty much anywhere with an internet connection.
- To get started, you just need to sign up for an API key and boom, you're in.
- From there, you can use the API to send requests to the models, which will process your input and send back the results. It's like having an AI wizard at your fingertips!

> **Don’t Worry!** We will dive deep into OpenAI API in few minutes and learn how can we fetch the API key, use it to run OpenAI API code. Let’s just focus on getting the hang of OpenAI API.

Now, let’s learn what are GPT models in OpenAI.

## What are GPT Models?

OpenAI have developed vast range of models those can perform different task. One of those models is GPT. It stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer" – yeah, it's a mouthful, I know – but what it means is that these models are trained on massive amounts of data, and then they can generate their own text based on that data. Crazy, right? These models can do things like generate realistic-sounding text, answer questions, and even write entire articles.

But it's not just about raw power – it's about what you can do with it. And that's where the creativity comes in. With OpenAI's GPT models, you can create all kinds of things, from chatbots to creative writing to AI-powered music. The possibilities are endless.

## So how can you create dope things using GPT models?

Basically, OpenAI’s API provides pre-trained GPT AI models that you can fine-tune to do specific tasks. These models have been trained on massive amounts of data and can generate responses that sound like they're straight outta a human brain. The GPT architecture is especially good at generating natural language responses, so you can create some seriously dope applications.

## Get the hang of GPT versions

OpenAI has been crushing it with their GPT models, which are some of the most advanced language models ever created. Check out these dope versions:

1. GPT-3
2. GPT-3.5
3. GPT-4

### OpenAI GPT-3 model

- This bad boy has 175 billion parameters, making it one of the biggest language models out there.
- GPT-3 was trained on a ton of data, like books, articles, and web pages, so it knows what's up.
- It can generate human-like text and do all sorts of cool natural language processing tasks.
- ChatGPT uses GPT-3 to spit out some of the slickest responses you've ever seen.

### OpenAI GPT-3.5 model

- With 6.7 billion parameters, GPT-3.5 is bigger than its predecessor GPT-2, but smaller than GPT-3.
- Its size makes it faster to train and easier to fine-tune, so it's perfect for specific use cases like text classification or language generation.

### OpenAI GPT-4 model

- The latest addition to the GPT family, GPT-4 isn't fully available to the public yet, but smaller versions are out there.
- Rumor has it that it's gonna have up to 10 trillion parameters, which is seriously mind-blowing.
- Its language generation is supposed to be even better than GPT-3, with text that sounds more natural and coherent. I can't wait to see what this thing can do!

Before writing our first program using Python and OpenAI API, let's quickly go over what an API key is and how can you generate it to access OpenAI API.

## What is the big deal about API key

An API key is a unique identifier that allows you to access an API. OpenAI is an AI research lab that provides powerful APIs for developers to use in their applications. In order to use OpenAI APIs, you need to generate an API key.

API Key is the combination of different random characters. Here’s an example of how API key looks like:

```

```

## Steps to generate an API key
Now, to get started:

1. You gotta create an account on the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Click on your profile and then click on Manage account then click on Billing.
3. Upgrade to a paid account. It's just a dollar a day, You can cancel whenever you want (Individual paid account). Without paid account you won't be able to fetch the API key from OpenAI.

Generating an API key for OpenAI is a straightforward process. Here are the steps:

1. Login to your [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) account.
2. Navigate to the API Keys section. You can find it by clicking on your profile icon on the top right corner of the screen and selecting "API Keys" from the drop-down menu.
3. Click on the "Generate New API Key" button and follow the instructions. Make sure to keep your API key safe and secure as it grants access to your OpenAI account.

## Quickstart OpenAI API

Let’s experiment with all the knowledge we have gained so far! Let’s write a simple Python program that will use OpenAI API to generate some text.

### Installation

To install the OpenAI API for Python, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install openai
```

If you have Python3 installed, run the following command:

```
pip3 install openai
```

Let’s look at this step happening visually:

![python code 1.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/raw/main/Build%20a%20YeBot%20with%20OpenAI%20API/2.%20WTH%20is%20OpenAI/Level%20Up%20Your%20AI%20knowledge%20befc6d8ff9634a49877abcf475e779e8/python_code_1.gif)

### Code

Let’s write a simple python code that will take prompt and generate the response using GPT-3 model. Don’t forget to replace the api key with your key.

```
import openai

# Set up your API key
openai.api_key = "Your API Key"

# Set up the prompt and parameters
prompt = "What is the meaning of life?"
model = "text-davinci-002"
temperature = 0.7
max_tokens = 100

# Generate text using OpenAI's GPT-3
response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine=model,
  prompt=prompt,
  temperature=temperature, 
  max_tokens=max_tokens
)

# Print the generated text
print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```

### Explanation

Let’s break down the code line-by-line and understand what is happening here.

```
import openai
```

- Here we are importing the necessary package and module: `openai`.

```
# Set up your API key
openai.api_key = "Your API Key"
```

- We set up the API key for OpenAI by assigning it to the `api_key` attribute of the `openai` module.

```
# Set up the prompt and parameters
prompt = "What is the meaning of life?"
model = "text-davinci-002"
temperature = 0.7
max_tokens = 100
```

- Here we are defining the prompt and model parameters for the OpenAI GPT-3 API. Let’s learn what they do one-by-one:
    - `prompt` is the starting text used to generate the response.
    - `model` is the type of model used to generate the response.
    - `temperature` is a value used to control the randomness of the response.
    - `max_tokens` is the maximum number of tokens the response can have.

```
# Generate text using OpenAI's GPT-3
response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine=model,
  prompt=prompt,
  temperature=temperature,
  max_tokens=max_tokens
)
```

- Now we are using the `openai.Completion.create()` method to generate text using the OpenAI GPT-3 API.
- Passing the previously defined `model`, `prompt`, `temperature`, and `max_tokens` parameters to the **`create()` method.

```
# Print the generated text
print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```

- Lastly, we are printing the generated text by accessing the `text` attribute of the first (and only) item in the `choices` list of the `response` object.
- The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the generated text before printing it to the console.

### Output

Now, we’re done with the explanation. Let’s look at what I got after running the code. PS: You might get different answer because each time we run the model it generates different answer.

## So let’s wrap up?

As we dive deeper into OpenAI's GPT models, let's keep in mind the responsibility that comes with this kind of power. We have the opportunity to create some truly amazing things, but we need to do it in a way that's ethical and responsible.
